AIE Programming Tutorial Part 2 Exercise

1. the 2nd as there are less lines of code and you do not have to run through a loop 15 times just do multiplication once which makes me think it might be 15 times faster

2. 1       3       6        10         15         21    dots
     1+2+3   3+3=6   6+4=10    10+5=15    15+6=21       addition to reach total dots
   1       2       3        4           5         6     triangle number
      1.5      2        2.5       3          3.5        multiple of desired triangle number to reach number of dots
	  
timeser .05 * trianglenumber +.05

CODE

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	int triangleNumber = 6;                            //the triangle we want to find the dots of
	double timeser = triangleNumber * 0.5 + 0.5;       // if 1*1.5=3 for the 2nd triangle it will have 3 dots we need to find a method of finding the 1.5 equivilent for each triangle and it turns out if you times the triangle by .5 and add .5 you get the 1.5 equivilent for a given triangle which you can use to find the dots
	double triangleDots = timeser * triangleNumber;    // the 1.5 equivilent * the triangle you are solving for returns the nubmer of dots

	std::cout << "number of dots in a " << triangleNumber << "is " << triangleDots << std::endl;

	system("pause");

	return 0;
